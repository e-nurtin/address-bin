# Address book



This is a small project I made using tkinter GUI.
It uses a json as a database.
You can just copy the code and run it in your IDE
and the program will create a json file if it's not present in the directory.

It also supports copying contacts which copies a text to your clipboard with all the available info of the selected contact in the format demonstrated below.

You can delete/edit contacts as well! 

I'm always open for suggestions regarding improving the code/design of the software.
